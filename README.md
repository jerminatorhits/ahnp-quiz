## AHNP Quiz:

This Rails 5 project logs unique user agents into a database and keeps track of number of times each agent has visited the website.

The live project can be found here: https://ahnp-test.herokuapp.com/

## Setup:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/jerminatorhits/ahnp-quiz.git`
2. Change directory into the folder using `cd ahnp-quiz`
3. Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `rails start` to start the server.
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

P.S. This project uses postgresql instead of the default sqlite database. Be sure to have postgresql installed and perform the necessary migrations if required.
